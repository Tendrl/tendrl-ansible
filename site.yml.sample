# This is an example of a ansible playbook to install Tendrl, automating steps
# from upstream *Tendrl Package Installation Reference*. You need to review it
# and either tweak it or use it as a starting point before installing
# Tendrl.

# The playbook expects inventory file with the following groups:
#
# * tendrl-server: a single machine where Tendrl Server (management console) is
#                  installed
# * gluster-servers: gluster storage servers (machines with bricks)
#
# Note that this is just an example which holds for this playbook, tendrl roles
# doesn't care how you group your servers in ansible inventory.

#
# Validation of prerequisities for Tendrl, doesn't modify machines in any way.
#

- include: prechecks.yml

#
# Workarounds required to run before the installation.
#

- include: workaround.disable-firewall.yml

#
# Run yum update.
#

- hosts: all
  user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Update all installed packages
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest

    # Moreover you need to use ip address of interface where etcd will be
    # listening, to configure etcd itself.
    - set_fact: etcd_ip_address={{hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_default_ipv4']["address"]}}

#
# Installation of Tendrl itself.
#

- hosts: tendrl-server
  user: root
  # When you uncomment this here (eg. because you are using sudo to switch to
  # root user account on the remote machines, make sure you change it in all
  # playbooks in this directory as well)
  # become: yes
  vars:
    # You need to specify fqdn where etcd will be listening, either by
    # value based on prior knowledge of your infrastructure:
    # etcd_fqdn: 'tendrl.example.com'
    # or using ansible facts: fqdn of tendrl-server as detected by ansible:
    etcd_fqdn: "{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
    # fqdn of graphite instance (carbon-cache service in particular) which will
    # be used in tendrl config files (this value doesn't reconfigure
    # graphite).
    # Note that a safe default value for fqdn of graphite is the same one
    # we use for etcd here (tendrl-server role places both services on the same
    # machine).
