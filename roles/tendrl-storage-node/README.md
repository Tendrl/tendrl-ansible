Tendrl Storage Node
===================

This role automates installation of *Tendrl Storage Node*, as described in
*Storage Node Installation* section of [Tendrl Package Installation
Reference](https://github.com/Tendrl/documentation/wiki/Tendrl-Package-Installation-Reference)

Requirements
------------

This role expects that the repositories with Tendrl packages (and it's
dependencies) are already available on the machine.

Role Variables
--------------

 *  Variable `selinux_mode` specifies which SELinux mode of `targeted` policy
    should be enabled: either `enforcing` or `permissive` (`enforcing` is the
    default).

 *  Variable `etcd_fqdn` needs to be set to fqdn of etcd instance.
    Specifying this variable is mandatory as there is no default value.

 *  Variable `graphite_fqdn` needs to be set to fqdn of graphite
    instance. Specifying this variable is mandatory as there is no default
    value.

 *  When `etcd_tls_client_auth` is set to False (which is the default state),
    tendrl components will be configured to work with etcd without any
    authentication (default etcd behavior).

    When `etcd_tls_client_auth` is True, all Tendrl components will be
    reconfigured to use client to server authentication with HTTPS client
    certificates.

    The placement of tls cert files can be tweaked via ansible variables
    explained below.

    For more details, see README file of tendrl server ansible role.

 *  Variable `etcd_cert_file` specifies full filepath of `ETCD_CERT_FILE` etcd
    option. The default value is `/etc/pki/tls/certs/etcd.crt`.

    For more details, see [Etcd Security
    model](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/op-guide/security.html)

 *  Variable `etcd_key_file` specifies full filepath of `ETCD_KEY_FILE` etcd
    option. The default value is `/etc/pki/tls/private/etcd.key`.

    For more details, see [Etcd Security
    model](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/op-guide/security.html)

 *  Variable `etcd_trusted_ca_file` specifies full filepath of
    `ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE` etcd option. The default value is
    `/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-etcd.crt`.

    For more details, see [Etcd Security
    model](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/op-guide/security.html)
